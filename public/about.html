<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi Guys! My name is Subhojeet Chanda. I am curently class 12th Passout student looking 
  forward to persue my Btech in computer science and engineering in specilization with Artificial 
  Inteligence and Machine Learning from VIT (Vellore Institute of Technology), Chennai Campus.
</p>

<p>The reason why I choose computer science and engineering is not because CSE students get more money
   (in terms of placement), but just because it is a sort thing of which I personally wanted to do. From my 
   Childhoor I was very muct interested in teche thinks which Smart Gadgets like Smart phones, Laptops, 
   Smart Watch and many more things. But it is not the only thing which I wanted to do, more or less 
   I wanted to be a Cricketer. But later on I realised that God have some different plans for me.
</p>

<p>But after all I am very much happy that I'll be doing my engineering in that field where I have my
   interest. But atlast it all depends on the skills which you develop in your precious four years.
